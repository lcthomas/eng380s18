Readings are due – meaning they should be completed – on the dates indicated. You should come to class prepared to discuss them.

The most accurate and up-to-date version of this calendar can be found on our course site. Use the online calendar to check on reading assignments, rather than this print version, since the print version of this syllabus will not be updated throughout the semester.

I reserve the right to change the course calendar as needed if it will benefit the class; adequate advance notice will always be given of any changes.

BB indicates that reading can be found on our Blackboard site on the “Readings” page.** **
